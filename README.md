The goal is to showcase the key features and benefits of the platform and entice users to download and use it for their virtual meetings and communication needs.

In this challenge, you have been tasked with creating an engaging layout, selecting suitable colors and typography, and organizing the content in a clear and concise manner. The page should highlight the platform's capabilities, such as face-to-face video calls, file sharing, screen sharing, and secure data encryption. Additionally, the landing page should communicate the ease of use and versatility of Meet, emphasizing its compatibility across different devices.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and elements of the web page.
  CSS: Applied styles to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the order summary card.
- Visual Studio Code: A powerful and popular code editor that provided a convenient and efficient development environment.
- Frontend Mentor: The project was completed as part of a challenge provided by Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor offers a range of real-life coding challenges to help developers practice their skills and improve their front-end development abilities.

The Meet landing page is built using HTML and CSS, which are core technologies for web development. HTML is used to structure the content and define the various sections of the page, while CSS is applied to style and position the elements.

To enhance the design and typography, you have imported the "Red Hat Display" font from Google Fonts and applied it to the appropriate elements using the font-family property.

The page incorporates responsive design techniques using media queries in CSS to ensure that the layout adapts and looks visually appealing on different screen sizes and devices. Styles specific to different viewport sizes, such as mobile, tablet, and desktop, have been implemented to provide optimal user experiences.

The layout and visual design of the page make use of images and backgrounds to create a visually engaging experience. Images are referenced within the HTML using the <img> tag and linked in the CSS using the url() function.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here are some key things I learned:

- HTML structure: I gained experience in creating the structure of a web page using HTML. I learned how to organize elements such as headings, paragraphs, and div containers to establish the layout of the order summary card.

- CSS styling: I learned how to apply CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of the order summary card. This included styling text, backgrounds, borders, and utilizing CSS selectors and properties to achieve the desired design.

Throughout the development of the Meet landing page, you have gained experience in HTML and CSS, including structuring content, applying styles, and creating responsive layouts. You have also learned how to leverage external fonts and incorporate media queries to enhance the page's responsiveness.

### Continued development

To further enhance the Meet landing page, you could consider the following areas for continued development:

Interactive Elements: Add interactive elements such as animated transitions, hover effects, or interactive buttons to enhance the user experience and make the page more engaging.

Accessibility: Ensure the page conforms to accessibility guidelines, making it usable and navigable for users with disabilities. Consider implementing proper semantic HTML elements, providing alternative text for images, and optimizing keyboard navigation.

SEO Optimization: Implement best practices for search engine optimization (SEO) by adding relevant meta tags, optimizing heading structure, and incorporating keywords to improve the page's visibility in search engine results.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the page's loading speed by compressing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and utilizing caching techniques. This will help improve the user experience and decrease bounce rates.

Integration with Backend: Consider integrating the landing page with a backend system to handle user registrations, authentication, and other interactive functionalities. This could involve setting up a server-side application and connecting it to a database.

By focusing on these areas, you can continue to refine and improve the Meet landing page, ensuring its effectiveness in promoting the video conferencing platform and providing an excellent user experience.
